Robert the Bruce was a 'bad guy' given he slaughtered the families in the North East (the Comyns). Should we blow up his statue? Or maybe demolish the Wallace monument?,0,,An91623930David,

Surely we must now all be calling for his statue in Stirling to be torn down? Sheer barbarism. ,23,,JamboAldo,
